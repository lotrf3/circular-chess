Circular Chess
==============

A browser based implementation of [Circular Chess](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_chess). Rules are the same as regular chess except that castling and en passant are not allowed. Also, pieces cannot make a "null move" by going all the way around the circle to return to their starting position.

This project uses [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/) to compile to a JavaScript, mostly canvas-based, UI.

It is hosted at [circular-chess.appspot.com](circular-chess.appspot.com) thanks to [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs).
